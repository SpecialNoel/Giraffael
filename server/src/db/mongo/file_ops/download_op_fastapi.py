# Download file from a room
# Note: the only intended way to use download_file() is to query target file from database 
#       to server_only/handle_requests/file_buffer_folder, then the server can send that file
#       to the client. Client download request has to be done this way given that server
#       has to first send the metadata of the file to the client, before the whole file can
#       be sent to the client.
